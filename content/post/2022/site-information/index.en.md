*Go, then, to all peoples everywhere and make them my disciples: baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,Â and teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And I will be with you always, to the end of the age.*

Mathew 28.19-20

**To the Glory of God and for the evangelization of all the world!**

We know: you came here finding more information about All Saints' Church in English.

For now, we're using a free content management system, hosted at a free server. Then, it's too hard to maintain a double, separate version.

So, while we're structuring a better version, we ask your patience or even help to make the two versions possible and available for everyone.

For found texts and Liturgies Bulletins in English, please, go to the [Portuguese version of the site](/) and search for content in English or [go directly to the English](/categories/english/) (categories).

The peace of the Lord be always with you.

**And with thy spirit.**
